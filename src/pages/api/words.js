      paragraphs: [
        "George Orwell’s Animal Farm, first published in 1945, is a political allegory that critiques totalitarianism, particularly Stalinism in the Soviet Union. The story follows a group of farm animals who, inspired by the dream of an old boar named Old Major, overthrow their human owner, Mr. Jones, in hopes of creating a society where all animals are equal and free. Initially, the farm, renamed Animal Farm, operates under the principles of \"Animalism,\" with the pigs, particularly Snowball and Napoleon, taking leadership roles in organizing the new society.",
        "However, the idealistic vision quickly unravels as Napoleon seizes power, exiling Snowball and establishing a dictatorship. He manipulates the animals through propaganda, fear, and revisionist history, using the loyal but naive cart-horse, Boxer, as a symbol of the exploited working class. The pigs gradually adopt human behaviors, living in luxury while the other animals suffer, and the farm’s original commandments are altered to justify their rule. The famous maxim \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\" highlights the hypocrisy and corruption of those in power.",
        "By the novel’s end, the pigs are indistinguishable from the humans they once opposed, illustrating Orwell’s warning about the cyclical nature of power and oppression. Animal Farm serves as a sharp critique of political systems that claim to serve the people while ultimately betraying them, making it a timeless and relevant commentary on authority, propaganda, and inequality."
